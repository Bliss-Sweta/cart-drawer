                    <ul>
                        <li>If your tracking number begins with a <strong>1Z</strong>
                            and is followed by digits and numbers, your package
                            is being carried by <strong>UPS</strong>. To track
                            this package, visit <a

                            long, your package is being carried by <strong>FedEx</strong>.

                            options.
                        </li>
                        <li>Some orders will be shipped via USPS Mail. The
                            easiest way to track these orders is by visiting the
                            <a href="https://www.usps.com/" target="_blank">USPS

                        <ul><li>For UPS, FedEx, and USPS you may also paste your
                                tracking number into Google Search and Google
                                will provide a direct link to your shipment

                            </li></ul>
                        <li>If your tracking number is referred to as a “PRO
                            Number” or the carrier information we sent is
                            different than either UPS or FedEx (e.g. YRC
                            Freight, XPO Logistics, etc.), your package is being
                            delivered by a freight company. To track this
                            package, visit the designated carrier’s website and
                            follow their onsite instructions for shipment
                            tracking.

                    <p>Occasionally, a carrier will scan a package as
                        “delivered” before it arrives at the final destination.
                        It may take an additional day or two for your package to
                        be delivered.</p>

                    <ul>

                            doormen, or the front desk to see if someone
                            accepted the delivery.
                        </li>
                        <li>Look around your delivery area. Carriers try to
                            leave packages in safe locations such as under
                            porches or benches, at back doors, or around
                            garages.
                        </li>
                        <li>Check your mailbox. Some smaller items may be
                            delivered there.
                        </li>
                        <li>Look for an attempted delivery notice. If the
                            carrier feels it is unsafe to leave your package at
                            your residence, the driver will leave an attempted

                    <p>To help us better answer any questions you have on a
                        product, having the SKU (stock keeping unit) is
                        important. The SKU is a unique identifier that helps us
                        keep track of our large product catalog.</p>
                    <p>The SKU number is located on every product page on our
                        site. Also, you can see a product’s SKU on any of our

                    <p>It is easy to see the availability of our products. On
                        any of our product pages, you can usually see
                        availability status beneath the “Add To Cart” panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>If an item is unavailable for purchase, you will see an
                        out of stock notification and you will not be able to
                        add the item to your cart.</p>

                        item that is currently out of stock, we will notify you
                        right away. You will then have the option to hold or

                        including all potential taxes and fees, add all items

                        to provide you with an optimal delivery experience. When
                        your order ships, we will email you a confirmation with
                        the tracking number for your shipment. We encourage you
                        to track your package with the carrier either over the

                        Boxes or Military APOs.
                    </p>
                    <p>We use the following shipping methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard Shipping</li>
                        <li>Curbside Delivery with Liftgate</li>
                        <li>Lift Gate &amp; Driveway Delivery</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Standard Shipping</h5>
                    <p>If chosen, the delivery will be via UPS or FedEx ground,
                        or potentially via freight line depending on the size of
                        the package. If the package is shipped via freight line,
                        then the customer will need to offload the package from
                        the back of the truck. Note: the truck driver is not
                        responsible for offloading merchandise.</p>
                    <h5>Curbside Delivery with Liftgate</h5>
                    <p>Only applicable for products that are too large for UPS
                        or FedEx and, as a result, ship via freight line. If
                        chosen, the merchandise will be offloaded from the
                        freight truck by a liftgate. The truck driver is
                        <strong>not</strong> required to move the merchandise
                        beyond the "curbside."
                    </p>
                    <h5>Lift Gate &amp; Driveway Delivery</h5>
                    <p>Only applicable for products that are too large for UPS
                        or FedEx and, as a result, ship via freight line. If
                        chosen, the merchandise will be offloaded from the
                        freight truck by a liftgate and delivered to the
                        driveway or garage, but <strong>not</strong> inside the
                        residence or building.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What is Lift-gate Service?</h5>
                    <p>A lift-gate is a device used to raise and lower items
                        from ground level to the level of a tractor trailer.
                        Freight companies deliver items on a tractor trailer
                        which is approx 56 inches above the ground. These
                        trailers are designed to load and unload at a loading
                        dock or with a forklift. If your delivery location does
                        not have a loading dock or forklift and the item is too
                        heavy to remove from the trailer by hand, then you may
                        need a lift-gate. Securing a lift-gate is ideal for
                        deliveries to residential areas, as well as commercial
                        areas that do not have loading docks.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Do I need lift-gate delivery?</h5>
                    <p>There are several ways to avoid paying lift-gate delivery
                        costs. If your delivery location has a loading dock or
                        forklift you do not need a lift-gate. If the individual
                        items in your shipment are light enough for you to
                        remove from the truck you do not need a lift-gate. If
                        you are willing to drive to the closest terminal and
                        pick up the freight from the delivery terminal, you do
                        not need a lift-gate. Terminal delivery is often a good
                        way to save both lift-gate and residential delivery
                        fees.

                    <h4>Order Confirmation</h4>
                    <p>After your order is completed, you will automatically be
                        sent an "Order Confirmation" email to the email address
                        you provided during checkout. The subject line will
                        read, "Order Confirmation from WebLife Stores" and will
                        contain your order number. This email is your receipt,
                        so please do not delete it! We encourage you to review
                        the order and advise us of any spelling or numerical
                        mistakes so that we can quickly make any necessary
                        changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you do not receive an "Order Confirmation" email from
                        us within 24 hours of placing your order, you may easily
                        and conveniently print a receipt for the order via My
                        Account if you registered an account.</p>
                    <h4>Sales Tax</h4>
                    <p>One of the best things about buying through WebLife
                        Stores is that we do not have to charge sales tax, with
                        one notable exception: orders shipping to Florida will
                        be subject to sales tax. WebLife Stores, LLC is not
                        responsible for individual states' sales tax reporting
                        laws pertaining to online purchases, so we encourage you
                        to check your state's regulations before you shop.
                    </p>
                    <p>Note to customers shipping to Colorado: Pursuant to
                        Colorado law, the purchaser is required to file a sales
                        or use tax return, and may be required to pay sales or
                        use tax on certain items.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Using Promotional Codes</h4>

                        for the various discounts and promotions we offer
                        periodically on select items. Should you receive a
                        promotion code from us via email, be sure to enter it
                        during checkout in order to apply the discount that is

                    </p>
                    <p><strong> Debit Cards:</strong> Please be aware that if
                        you process your order with a debit card, a
                        preauthorization hold will immediately be placed on your
                        account to reserve funds for this transaction. This hold
                        may appear separately on your account from the
                        authorization itself, but should fall off within a few
                        days once the transaction clears. Please contact your
                        financial institution for details, as policies regarding
                        holds can vary and are beyond our control.

                    <p>If your card was declined, then there should have been an
                        error message at the top of the check-out explaining the
                        reason. If the error message is not clearly understood,
                        you can do a search in Google for that specific error
                        message to find a potential reason for it.
                    </p>
                    <p>It may be that your financial institution flagged an
                        order as high-risk because it was either out of state or
                        because the purchase was being made online. Typically,
                        these flags can be removed if you contact your financial
                        institution and request that they approve the purchase.

                            become a supplier?</h4>
                
                    <p>The Internet has created a tremendous opportunity for
                        manufacturers to drive additional revenue growth and
                        reach a new and growing set of customers. For seven
                        years, we have enabled our suppliers to successfully tap
                        into this growth while working closely with them to
                        protect and promote their brand, complement their
                        existing retail channels and facilitate smooth logistics
                        and communications flow. We understand the importance of
                        flexibility and tailor our approach to meet our
                        suppliers' specific needs. We value our supplier
                        relationships and believe these to be the key elements
                        to fostering a successful partnership:

                    <p><strong>Commitment to Growth</strong> – Our goal is to
                        rapidly grow revenues and become the top online channel

                        significant product expertise combined with our ongoing

                    <p><strong>Partnership in Customer Service Excellence</strong>
                        – WebLife Stores’ ability to provide great customer

                        orders quickly, package products with care, provide
                        accurate in-stock status and work with us to rapidly
                        handle any issues that may arise.

                        to tell their products' stories the way they want them
                        told. We are sensitive to our suppliers' desire to have
                        a consistent value proposition and brand message across
                        all of their retail outlets and we work closely to

                        suppliers' existing sales channels.

                    <p><strong>Flexibility and Ease</strong> – Each of our
                        suppliers works closely with a WebLife Stores’ category
                        team that is highly proficient at taking the supplier
                        through the entire process of: (1) establishing the
                        relationship, (2) effectively merchandising the product,
                        (3) driving growth and (4) providing excellent customer
                        service. We understand that every supplier may have
                        unique needs in areas of logistics, order flow,
                        payments, returns, etc. and we try to tune our approach
                        to match our suppliers' needs and to make the entire
                        process as smooth and seamless as possible.</p>

                    <p>We are an online retailer only. Apart from our online
                        venue, we do not have a brick and mortar storefront
                        where you can view our products.

    <h3>How Will My Order Ship?</h3>
    
    <div class="tab-inside-content">
        <p>Thank you for your order! We will ship your order using the fastest,
                safest, and most reliable method possible. Every product on our
                site has been carefully selected to ship by a particular
                shipping method in order to provide you with an optimal delivery
                experience. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When your order ships, we will notify you via
                        email. Included in your email will be a tracking number
                        for your shipment. We encourage you to track your
                        package online or on the phone with the carrier. Most
                        companies can provide an estimated delivery date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Be sure to contact us if anything seems
                        unusual with the progress of the shipment. You can also
                        track your packages via My Account, if you registered an
                        account when placing the order. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Please note we cannot ship to P.O. Boxes or
                        Military APOs. We have various methods of shipment
                        available: Small Parcel, Truck Freight - Back of Truck,
                        and Truck Freight - Threshold:</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
            <h4>Small Parcel</h4>
        
       
        <p>Whenever possible, we will ship smaller, lighter
                items via UPS, FedEx, DHL or USPS. These companies provide the
                fastest, most reliable method of shipping available for many
                items we sell. Depending on how close you are to the shipping
                warehouse, your item will arrive between 1 and 6 business days
                (1 to 10 business days for USPS) after it leaves the warehouse.
                We do not require an adult signature for deliveries; however,
                please note that the decision to leave your package without a
                signature is at the discretion of the delivery person. If you
                want an item left at your doorstep, the best thing to do is
                leave a note on your door asking the driver to leave your
                package with "No Signature Required." Be sure to include your
                name and tracking number on the note.</p>
        
        
            <h4>Truck Delivery</h4>
       
        
        <p>Many items on our website are too large and/or too
                heavy to ship via UPS/FedEx. Truck Delivery is different than
                standard UPS, FedEx, or US Mail in two ways: (1) Once your
                merchandise arrives at the delivery agent’s pick-up location,
                he/she will call you to set up a delivery appointment. Most
                truck delivery companies offer appointment windows (usually 2-4
                hours) between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm EST, Monday through Friday;
                and (2) The products will be delivered to the driveway or
                outside curb of the delivery address provided upon purchase. It
                is the customer’s responsibility to transport the product(s)
                inside; however, several truck freight companies offer
                additional services to help move merchandise from the truck into
                your home or office.</p>
        
        <p>At the time your merchandise leaves the warehouse, we
                will email you the tracking information and you can contact the
                shipper directly to inquire about additional shipping services.
                In this event, it is your responsibility to directly pay the
                truck delivery carrier for any additional services. </p>
        
        <p>Please make sure that you inspect the package(s) at
                the time of delivery. If the box has any damage, or if there is
                any reason you are concerned with its packaging or delivery,
                please write, “Product Damaged” clearly on the sheet the
                delivery agent asks you to sign. This simply ensures that if
                there is any damage, it will be easy to take care of the
                problem, and your order will be fulfilled as soon as possible.</p>
        
        
            <h4>Truck Freight Threshold</h4>
       
        
        <p>This method is just like "Truck Freight - Back of
                Truck" (see above), with the exception that the truck freight
                company will deliver your order to the threshold of your home
                (to your garage or front door) if yours is a residential
                delivery, or to the loading dock if yours is a commercial
                delivery.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, the truck freight company is not
                authorized to perform any assembly services nor can they place
                any items in a room of your choice. Once we email you the
                tracking information, you may contact the shipper directly to
                arrange for any additional services that you would like. You
                will be responsible for directly paying the truck freight
                carrier for any additional services.</p>
       
            <h5>About Estimated Shipping Times</h5>
        
        <p>At WebLife Stores, we do our best to provide you with
                accurate shipping times for our products. These shipping times
                are estimates only.</p>
        
        <p>The "Usually Ships In" time-frame quoted on our
                website is provided to WebLife Stores by each manufacturer and
                it is an estimate of the average number of business days it
                takes the manufacturer to process your order and ship the item
                from their warehouse. These shipping times are not a guarantee.
                If you have a time-sensitive project, we recommend that you call
                a sales specialist at (844) 534-7230 or Live Chat to arrange
                expedited shipping.</p>
        
        <p>Products marked "In Stock" on our website are items
                that we have in stock or items for which the manufacturer has
                provided us a real-time inventory feed. These items normally
                ship from the warehouse within two business days; however, these
                products are subject to prior sale and availability and lead
                times are not guaranteed.</p>
        
        <p>Occasionally, items shown to be in stock or available
                on our website get pre-sold. In this case, you will be sent an
                email notification that your item is on backorder, at which
                time, you will have the option to continue to wait for that
                item, cancel your order for a full refund, or select a different
                item to order. Custom made products can have varying ship times
                and we recommend ordering custom products well in advance to
                avoid any possible project delays.</p>
        
        
            <h4>Free Shipping?</h4>
        
        
        <p>Items marked “FREE SHIPPING!” on the product page
                will ship for free! Shipping charges, if any, will be indicated
                in your shopping cart and covers ground shipping within the
                continental United States. We won’t surprise you with any hidden
                charges or handling fees. The price you see in the shopping cart
                is the price you pay, with one exception: if you are shipping an
                order to Florida, we are required to charge sales tax. Beware of
                companies who mask their shipping charges and surprise you with
                prohibitive shipping and handling fees or oversize charges at
                the end of the checkout process. Make sure you know the total
                cost of your purchase when shopping around.</p>
        <p>Exclusions: Certain products we offer do carry
                associated shipping charges, either per-item or per-order
                amount. The total item shipping charges, if any, will be
                detailed in the shopping cart page prior to checkout.</p>
        
        <p>The “Order Amount” for promotional shipping offers
                does not include, and the offer does not apply to, gift cards,
                bulk orders, applicable shipping charges, international fees, or
                sales tax. A shipping surcharge will apply to orders going to
                Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories. Some items have specific
                shipping charges, which amounts are not eligible to count toward
                the qualifying amount for reduced shipping rates or free
                shipping offers. Other eligible items in your cart at time of
                checkout will still count toward the qualifying total.</p>
        
        <p>Here at WebLife Stores, we keep it simple. Our
                pricing is straightforward and all-inclusive, which saves you
                time and energy while providing a seamless shopping experience.</p>

                result, we do not have the ability to offer exchanges. The

                to be considered. However, we will reach out to the vendor as a
                courtesy to determine if they are willing to accept returns
                outside this period.</p>
        
    
            <h4>Which items are eligible for return?</h4>
       
            <p>Residential or commercial items not marked custom, made-to-order,
                or non-returnable are eligible but are subject to the vendor’s
                terms and approval.</p>
            <p>Items must be returned in the condition they were received,
                including all accessories, documentation, and packaging
                materials. Items that have been assembled, installed, or
                modified cannot be returned.</p>
           
                <p class="center-text"><span class="red">Advisory regarding the return of
                        large commercial items:</span></p>
                <p class="center-text">Heavy commercial items, even if they are listed with free
                    shipping, must be returned at your expense (excluding cases
                    involving damaged, defective, or incorrect items).</p>
           
            <p>Compounded with the restocking fees referenced below, this can be
                quite costly and may render the return impractical. You may be
                able to recover more of your initial cost by reselling the items
                yourself.</p>
            <p>We strongly encourage researching products thoroughly and
                consulting our support team with any questions prior to making a
                purchase.</p>
     
    
            <h4>When will I hear back regarding my
                    request?</h4>
        
            <p>Upon receipt of a return request, we will reach out to the vendor
                to request an RGA (Return Goods Authorization) number and follow
                up with you by email within 1-2 business days. We prefer to
                manage return requests via email to ensure you have a record of
                any instructions we’ve provided.</p>
            <p class="center-text"><span class="red">IMPORTANT:</span>
                Orders returned without authorization are <strong>not</strong>
                eligible for refund. You <strong>must</strong> obtain an RGA
                number to ensure proper processing of your return.</p>
    
    
            <h4>How much will I be refunded?</h4>
        
            <p>We will refund the value of the returned items following receipt
                and inspection by the vendor.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for the cost and arrangement of return
                shipping. If your order shipped under our Free Shipping
                promotion, the outbound shipping and handling costs will be
                deducted from your refund.</p>
            <p>If items are not returned in the condition they were originally
                shipped, your refund may be adjusted or deemed ineligible.</p>
            <p>Commercial or bulk returns are subject to restocking fees, as
                outlined below.</p>
       
    
            <h4>Do you charge restocking fees?</h4>
        
            <p>We do not currently charge restocking fees for residential item
                returns.</p>
            <p>Commercial or bulk returns are subject to a 25% restocking fee.
                However, all Florence Corporation items are subject to a 30%
                restocking fee.</p>
            <p>A return is considered bulk if any combination of five (5) or
                more items are being returned (including residential items).</p>
       
    
            <h4>What if an item is missing, damaged,
                    defective, or incorrect?</h4>

            <h4>What if My Order Arrives
                    Damaged?</h4>
       
            <p>We strive to have all packages arrive on your doorstep snug,
                safe, and secure. We refuse to sell products that are easily
                damaged during shipping.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If your order is delivered with no signature required, open
                    all packages, inspect the products, and notify us of any
                    damage or missing items within 48 hours of delivery.</li>
                <li>If your order is delivered by LTL freight and requires a
                    signature, check every side of all boxes and note ANY damage
                    to packaging by writing "Package Damaged” on BOL before
                    signing. Also note any missing items on BOL. The driver
                    should allow you a few minutes for that inspection. If the
                    driver does not allow for that inspection - note that on the
                    BOL before signing. (If the package looks significantly
                    damaged, you may refuse delivery. In this case, please
                    notify us so that we can expect the return shipment.)</li>
                <li>After delivery, open all packages, fully inspect the product
                    for any concealed damage or missing items, and report that
                    to us as well as the shipping company within 48 hours.</li>
                <li>If you received a damaged product or the wrong product and
                    we cannot solve the issue with either a full replacement or
                    replacement parts, we will pay to return the item to us, in
                    addition to issuing the refund.</li>
                <li>If your product has a manufacturer’s defect, we will contact
                    the manufacturer to either replace the defective part or, if
                    necessary, the entire unit.</li>
            </ul>
        
 
            <h4>Items Missing
                    from an Order</h4>
        
            <p>If your tracking information shows that your package was
                delivered, but you are unable to find it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify the shipping address is correct.</li>
                <li>Look for any notice of attempted delivery.</li>
                <li>Look around the delivery location for your package.</li>
                <li>Check to see if someone else accepted the delivery.</li>
                <li>Some packages may travel with multiple carriers. Check your
                    mailbox or wherever you receive mail.</li>
                <li>Wait 24 hours. In rare cases, packages may say "delivered"
                    up to 24 hours prior to arrival.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your package was insured. The insurance on the package will take
                care of replacing the lost shipment. As with any insurance
                claim, there is a process that must be followed in order to have
                the lost shipment replaced.</p>
            <p>If your package is missing from a delivery, you (as the
                RECIPIENT) MUST contact the Carrier (UPS, FedEx, etc.)
                immediately. The sooner the Carrier is notified, the sooner the
                tracer and claim can be initiated for your missing package.</p>
            <p>WEBLIFE STORES, LLC will not be responsible for any order that is
                tracked and delivered but not received. However, after you file
                a claim with the Carrier (UPS or FedEx) you must contact us so
                that we can assist you with the replacement of the missing
                shipment.</p>
